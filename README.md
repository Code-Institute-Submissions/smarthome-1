Amenity, Smart House Manager, is a new technology company seeking to provide a
demonstration (Demo) website that will showcase their product's interactive controls and 
scheduling capabilities, without being connected to a set of home appliances and products. 
Amenity's Demo control panel must provide a potential buyer with the opportunity to play 
with the function inputs and controls to gain an understanding of the scope of the product 
and how the controls interact with one another. The Scheduler section of the Demo will 
show how functions, for example lighting, can be turned on and off ahead of time, in the 
whole house or in a specific room. Amenity's goal for this Demo site is to have the user 
leave the Demo with a clear understanding of the basic functionality of the product and 
how this technology could work for them.

The target audience is home owners looking for a fully-integrated smart house
manager, easily controlled through mobile devices. This website is not intended to sell 
the product, it is only to be used as a Demo of the coreproduct. It's important that the 
user see the types of controls that can be accessed remotely and how scheduling is 
integrated into the system. The website will likely be used while working with a 
salesperson, either on the phone or in-person, so instructional directions are not 
required on the website. However, it is expected that the control
elements will be intuitive to use.

## UX

### Targeted Demo Customers
* Own home 
* Currently possess or plan to purchase products and appliances for the home that are 
capable of being wirelessly controlled by a smart house manager.
* Have explored Amenity's smart-house manager product and have enough interest in the
product that they are willing to devote time to exploring the product's capabilities
through a Demo.

### This Demo is being commissioned:

* to provide potential customers with the opportunity to try out the controls and 
functionality without having to first connect with their home products, as many other 
software packages require;
